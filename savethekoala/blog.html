          <h3>Kola in Danger Near You?</h3>

          <p>
            There is currently no legislation, anywhere in the country, that can protect Koalas and Koala habitat in
            Australia. The listing of the koala as “vulnerable” under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
            Conservation Act in 2012 changed nothing.</p>
            <span id="text">

          <p>
            This is supposed to be the premier law for protecting Australia’s environment, yet it is powerless. By the
            time you read this page the bulldozers may already be working, but it is not too late to take action. Below
            we have listed some of the things that might make a difference.</p>

          <p>Join the Koala Army. The Australian Koala Foundation is committed to the introduction of a
            Koala Protection Act to provide real legislative protection for koalas, and we need your help.</p>

          <p>Media attention can help. Contact your local newspaper. Often they will have an environmental
            reporter who may be interested in the plight of your Koalas. Write letters to the editor of your local and
            national newspapers.</p> </span>

          <p>Speak to your federal member. The Government needs to hear your story to convince them to
            protect Koalas and their habitat. <a href="contact.html">Contact us.</a></p>

          <h3>Joey Facts</h3>
          <p>Baby Koalas are known as ‘Joeys'. Scientists often refer to them using terms like
            ‘juveniles',‘pouch young' and ‘back young'.</p>

          <p>
            Younger breeding females usually give birth to one Joey each year, depending on a range of factors. However,
            not all females in a wild population will breed each year. Some, especially older females, will produce
            offspring only every two or three years.
          </p>
          <span id="text2">
          <p>
            When the Joey is born, it’s only about 2 centimetres long, is blind and furless and its ears are not yet
            developed. On its amazing journey to the pouch, it relies on its well-developed senses of smell and touch,
            its strong forelimbs and claws, and an inborn sense of direction. Once in the pouch, it attaches itself to
            one of the two teats which swells in its mouth, preventing it from being dislodged from its source of food.
          </p>

          <p>The Joey stays in its mother’s pouch for about 6 or 7 months, drinking only milk. Before it
            can tolerate gumleaves, which are toxic for most mammals, the joey must feed on a substance called ‘pap'
            which is a specialised form of the mother’s droppings that is soft and runny. This allows the mother to pass
            on to the joey special micro-organisms from her intestine which are necessary for it to be able to digest
            the gumleaves. It feeds on this for a period of up to a few weeks, just prior to it coming out of the pouch
            at about 6 or 7 months of age.</p>

          <p>
            After venturing out of the pouch, the Joey rides on its mother’s abdomen or back, although it continues to
            return to her pouch for milk until it is too big to fit inside. The joey leaves its mother’s home range
            between 1 and 3 years old, depending on when the mother has her next joey. You can adopt your own Joey here!

          <h3>More Koala Facts</h3>
          <p>Habitat loss is the greatest threat to Koalas. The main reasons for this are land clearing,
            bushfires and diseases of the eucalypts, like ‘dieback' which cause the trees to die. The AKF wants a Koala
            Protection Act, which means that Koala trees can’t be touched. Donate today to help us achieve this for
            Koalas.</p>
            <span id="text3">
          <p> The AKF estimates that there are likely to be less than 80,000 Koalas remaining in Australia
            today and it could be as low as 43,000. Much of their habitat has already been lost. This makes it vitally
            important to save what is left.</p>
          <p>Australia has one of the highest land clearing rates in the world. 80% of Koala habitat has
            already disappeared.</p>
          <p>There are well over 700 varieties of eucalypts. Koalas eat only some of these. They are very
            fussy eaters and have strong preferences for different types of gum leaves. Within a particular area, as few
            as one, and generally no more than two or three species of eucalypt will be regularly browsed (we call these
            'primary browse trees') while a variety of other species, including some non-eucalypts, appear to be browsed
            occasionally or used for just sitting or sleeping in.</p>

      <p>Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading
